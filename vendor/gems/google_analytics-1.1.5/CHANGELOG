= 1.1.5

* Tidy up documentation a little.
* Wrap the generated JS code in an exception-catching block, just in case.
* Start keeping a CHANGELOG!

= 1.1.4

This version was never properly released as a gem on Rubyforge.  Oops.

* Be careful to retain body tag attributes.
* Allow the body tags to be in uppercase.  We won't judge. :)
