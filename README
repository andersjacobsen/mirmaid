## miRMaid

MirMaid is data about microRNAs structured for easier access and integration, especially for computer-geeks

* The core of MirMaid is the data contained in miRBase, which is the de facto accepted standard registry for microRNA information and nomenclature.
* MirMaid takes miRbase data, reorganises it slightly and provides a programming interface to the data, which makes it much easier for the computer-savvy to perform complex data queries and analysis.
* MirMaid is extendable, meaning that additional data and functionality can easily be implemented as plugins.
* Although MirMaid also provides a basic web point-and-click-interface, the project focuses on the programmatic access to data.

A core feature of MirMaid is the many different but still intuitive and uniform access levels and representations of the data:

http://current.mirmaid.org/species/cel/matures          # HTML representation
http://current.mirmaid.org/species/cel/matures.xml      # XML representation
http://current.mirmaid.org/species/cel/matures.fa       # Fasta representation
Species.find_by_abbreviation('cel').matures             # Ruby object-relational model
